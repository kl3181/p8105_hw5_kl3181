## Problem 1

Read in the data and clean.

```{r}
homicide_df = 
  read.csv("./homicide_data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ "solved"
    ),
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_")
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

Create aggregate DF

```{r}
aggregate_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

Proportion test for a single city 

```{r}
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved),
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

Iteration for all cities

```{r}
results_df = 
  aggregate_df %>% 
  mutate(
     prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
     tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
   ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

```{r}
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

## Problem 2

Tidy the data!

```{r}
path_df = 
  tibble(
    path = list.files("lda_data")
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    path = str_c("lda_data/", path),
    data = map(path, read_csv)) %>% 
  unnest(data) %>%
  separate(path, into = c("folder", "arm"), sep = 9) %>%
  separate(arm, into = c("arm", "subject_id"), sep = "_") %>% 
  separate(subject_id, into = c("subject_id", "na"), sep = 2) %>% 
  select(-folder, -na) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week", 
    values_to = "observation",
    names_prefix = "week_"
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    subject_id = str_remove(subject_id, "^0+"),
    week = as.numeric(week),
    subject_id = as.numeric(subject_id)
    )

path_df
```

Making a spaghetti plot

```{r}
path_df %>% 
  group_by(subject_id) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = observation, color = arm)) +
  geom_path() +
  labs(
    title = "Observations on each subject over time",
    x = "Week", 
    y = "Observation"
  )
```

Observations appear to be more similar between the two treatment arms at the beginning of the study, and increase in range of observations as the weeks go by. The experimental group seems to have larger observations which increase over time while the control group seems to stay consistent with quite a bit of variation for each study subject. 


## Problem 3

Creating the t-test function.

```{r}
t_test = function(sample_size = 30, mu, sigma = 5) {
  simulation = 
    tibble(x = rnorm(n = sample_size, mean = mu, sd = sigma))
  simulation %>% 
  t.test() %>% 
  broom::tidy()
}
```

Setting mu equal to 0 

```{r}
sim_results = 
  rerun(5000, t_test(mu = 0)) %>% 
  bind_rows()

sim_results %>% 
  select(estimate, p.value)
```

Repeating for means 1 to 6.

```{r}
rep_sim_results = 
  tibble(mean = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)) %>% 
  mutate(
    output_lists = map(.x = mean, ~rerun(5000, t_test(mu = .x))),
    estimate_dfs = map(output_lists, bind_rows)) %>% 
  select(-output_lists) %>% 
  unnest(estimate_dfs)

rep_sim_results %>% 
  select(mean, estimate, p.value)
```


Making a plot to show proportion of times the null was rejected on the y axis and true value of µ on the x axis.

```{r}
rep_sim_results %>% 
  select(mean, estimate, p.value) %>% 
  group_by(mean) %>% 
  summarize(prop_reject = sum(p.value <= 0.05) / n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = mean, y = prop_reject, fill = mean)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  labs(
    title = "Proportion Null Rejected Given True µ",
    x = "True µ",
    y = "Power of Test"
  )
```

We can see that the power of the test increases as we increase the true mean further from 0. This makes sense that the further away the true mean is, the more times we would reject the null.



Making a plot showing the average estimate of µ on y axis and true value of µ on x axis overlaid on a plot showing the average estimate of µ only in samples for which the null was rejected on the y axis on the true value of µ on the x axis.  

```{r}
all_samples = 
  rep_sim_results %>% 
    select(mean, estimate, p.value) %>% 
    group_by(mean) %>% 
    summarize(all = mean(estimate))

rejected_samples = 
  rep_sim_results %>% 
    select(mean, estimate, p.value) %>% 
    filter(p.value <= 0.05) %>% 
    group_by(mean) %>% 
    summarize(null_reject = mean(estimate))

left_join(all_samples, rejected_samples, by = "mean") %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    all:null_reject,
    names_to = "sample",
    values_to = "average_estimate"
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = mean, y = average_estimate, color = sample)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Average estimate of µ versus true µ",
    x = "True µ",
    y = "Average Estimate of µ"
  )
```

We can see that when we include all samples, the average estimate of µ correlates very well with the true µ. However, when we include only samples that have been rejected, the sample average of µ is not equal to the true value of µ especially when the true value of µ is closer to 0.
