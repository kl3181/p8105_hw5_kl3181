## Problem 1

Read in the data and clean.

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read.csv("./homicide_data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ "solved"
    ),
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_")
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

Create aggregate DF

``` r
aggregate_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Proportion test for a single city

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved),
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample… two.sided

Iteration for all cities

``` r
results_df = 
  aggregate_df %>% 
  mutate(
     prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
     tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
   ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

``` r
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

## Problem 2

Tidy the data\!

``` r
path_df = 
  tibble(
    path = list.files("lda_data")
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    path = str_c("lda_data/", path),
    data = map(path, read_csv)) %>% 
  unnest(data) %>%
  separate(path, into = c("folder", "arm"), sep = 9) %>%
  separate(arm, into = c("arm", "subject_id"), sep = "_") %>% 
  separate(subject_id, into = c("subject_id", "na"), sep = 2) %>% 
  select(-folder, -na) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week", 
    values_to = "observation",
    names_prefix = "week_"
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    subject_id = str_remove(subject_id, "^0+"),
    week = as.numeric(week),
    subject_id = as.numeric(subject_id)
    )
```

Making a spaghetti plot

``` r
path_df %>% 
  group_by(subject_id) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = observation, color = arm)) +
  geom_path() +
  labs(
    title = "Observations on each subject over time",
    x = "Week", 
    y = "Observation"
  )
```

Observations appear to be more similar between the two treatment arms at
the beginning of the study, and increase in range of observations as the
weeks go by. The experimental group seems to have larger observations
which increase over time while the control group seems to stay
consistent with quite a bit of variation for each study subject.

## Problem 3

Simulations\!\! Sample from a normal distribution - sample size 30, std
5, change the mean (1 to 6) with 5000 datasets for each different mean.

Exporting results of hypothesis test to see if mean = 0. (t-test)

See what happens as you move from 0 to 1 and conduct t-test along the
way. Start with sim.mean and std function to export t-tests instead

estimate, p-value

plots: - filter(show results when p value is less than 0.5 and what does
the mean look like) -
